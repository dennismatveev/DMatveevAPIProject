To whom it may concern,

    My name is Dennis Matveev,
    This project does not have any special directions needed to run it.
    This project is designed to retrieve college data using an API key,
        the current fields that are displayed are the school name, school city,
        student size in 2018 & 2017, 2017 earnings 3 years after completion of college,
        as well as the 2016 repayment after 3 years.
        The retrieved data is placed into a database, where it is organized by each of the fields.

        On the top of the database, you will see all the fields which is created upon the creation of the database.
        Next I traversed through the dictionary elements of my list, and assigned each element to the respected field.

    There is nothing missing from the code.
