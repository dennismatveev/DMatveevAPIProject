To whom it may concern,

    My name is Dennis Matveev,
    This project does not have any special directions needed to run it.
    This project is designed to retrieve college data using an API key,
        the current fields that are displayed are the id, school name, school city,
        student size in 2018 & 2017, 2017 earnings 3 years after completion of college,
        as well as the 2016 repayment after 3 years.
        The retrieved data is placed into a database, where it is organized by each of the fields.

        Requirements.txt was created so the .yml was able to get the necessary dependencies:
        requests & openpyxl

        On the top of the database, you will see all the fields which is created upon the creation of the database.
        Next I traversed through the dictionary elements of my list, and assigned each element to the respected field.

        Two tests were setup. One that verifies that over 1000 data was entered, and the another tests that
        a new database can be created and it will have a chosen unique id for the school.

        Initially I had Test#2 create a new table, and then had it verify if the table was created.
        After rereading the instruction for the code, I decided to get rid of this as it wasn't what
        the test was asking for. So I changed it to determine if a specific key is in the new database that is created.


    Receives data from Excel file, creates new table, and populates database with current data:
        Occupation code, State, Occupation Title of type Major, Total employment for that state, and the
        25th percentile salary of the occupation in that state

        Four more tests were created: One to test if data from more than 50 states was collected. Another to test
        if the new table exists in the database. As well as if the first(api) table exists too. The last test
        verified that a certain datapoint existed in the new table that was created from the excel file.

    * Just fyi: The GitHub Test took about 5-10 minutes to run and complete. I believe this is due to me having it
    create the db and populate it in each test. Since I was under the impression each test must be independent of
    everything else. *

    There is nothing missing from the code.
