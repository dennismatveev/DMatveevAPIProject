To whom it may concern,

    My name is Dennis Matveev,
    This project does not have any special directions needed to run it.
    This project is designed to retrieve college data using an API key,
        the current fields that are displayed are the school name, school city,
        student size in 2018 & 2017, 2017 earnings 3 years after completion of college,
        as well as the 2016 repayment after 3 years.
        The retrieved data is placed into a database, where it is organized by each of the fields.

        On the top of the database, you will see all the fields which is created upon the creation of the database.
        Next I traversed through the dictionary elements of my list, and assigned each element to the respected field.

        Two tests were setup. One that verifies that over 1000 data was entered, and the another tests that
        a new database can be created and it will have a chosen unique id for the school.

        Initially I had Test#2 create a new table, and then had it verify if the table was created.
        After rereading the instruction for the code, I decided to get rid of this as it wasn't what
        the test was asking for. So I changed it to determine if a specific key is in the new database that is created.

    There is nothing missing from the code.
